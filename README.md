# NumberScraper
extracting phone numbers from noisy plain text

#### The project has two part - library and UI app

### The library
Uses multiple techniques to achive 95%+ productivity.  
A lot of fallback behaviours applied depending on the context.  
It's very fast because I used pure string methods raither than`regex`.  


### The UI app
